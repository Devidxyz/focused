# Focused E2E tests

To run E2E tests, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory, with the following content:

```
EXTENSION_ID='jhedmiocnocoffkleapnibgkpdendlnp'
```

Change the value of the `EXTENSION_ID` with your local extension's `ID` that you can find in the URL of the options page.
